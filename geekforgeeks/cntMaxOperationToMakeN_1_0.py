Maximize pair decrements required to reduce all array elements except one to 0

Given an array arr[] consisting of N distinct elements, the task is to find the maximum number of pairs required to be decreased by 1 in each step, such that N â€“ 1 array elements are reduced to 0 and the remaining array element is a non-negative integer.

Examples:

    Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    Decrease arr[1] and arr[2] by 1 modifies arr[] = {1, 1, 2} 
    Decrease arr[1] and arr[2] by 1 modifies arr[] = {1, 0, 1} 
    Decrease arr[0] and arr[2] by 1 modifies arr[] = {0, 0, 0} 
    Therefore, the maximum number of decrements required is 3.
     

    Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    Output: 7
